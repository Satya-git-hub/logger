# Logger 

Logging is a means of tracking events that happen when some software runs. Logging is important for software developing, debugging, and running. If you donâ€™t have any logging record and your program crashes, there are very few chances that you detect the cause of the problem. And if you detect the cause, it will consume a lot of time. With logging, you can leave a trail of breadcrumbs so that if something goes wrong, we can determine the cause of the problem.
